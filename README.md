# Zacks OpenShift Helpers

This repository contains Golang programs which are most likely to be of use to
fellow OpenShift developers, especially members of the
[machine-config-operator](https://github.com/openshift/machine-config-operator)
team. The helpers found here may be of use to you. They may not. They may
completely break entirely.

Eventually, I intend to produce pre-built binaries using goreleaser and GitHub
Actions. But for now, you'll have to clone this repo and build the commands.
